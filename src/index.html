    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Sunday Boys are an unauditioned, inclusive choir for gay
    men and their allies that rehearse on Sunday evenings. We sing
    the songs together that we love as individuals. We come
    together to sing, and in doing so we meet new people, build
    great friendships and deliver an exciting programme of gigs
    throughout the year.</p>
    <h3>Why we need you now</h3>
    <p>Stay connected and The Sunday Boys will accompany you
    through life as restrictions ease and we can meet live again.
    Get your regular fix of music and community, and help The
    Sunday Boys to pay the fantastic artists and composers who keep
    us going in these tough times.</p>
